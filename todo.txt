fallback if DNSMASQ not available
display dashboard
use a config file
status command




test virtualhost resolv
modular vhosts

test should include if other httpd running
define netcat logger in config files
status should give warning message when no owned processes are running.
hosts more modular with files

simply skip dnsmasq if not present
The assumption should be to start server in current location but differentiate between scaffolding and adopting
Add option to list server locations or at least to recall that one has been installed already


At some point need to do a commit comparison to decide whether to download

detect curl errors
add ability to change port number or at least detect that port 80 is in use
need to improve logging
Argument for specific websites
make recognize developer repo for streamlining development

really need to simplify structure for vhosts
use clients/client.site/wwwroot
If PID file is gone or doesnt work get server name
As it the status command just looks up whatever instances are not running but doesnt confirm that they were spawned by http byob
should indicate scaffold directory when the prompt comes up
Need someway to check if a container is being used already
need to separate out files so that its clear


instead of listing all found documents push missing to array and then report that at once
Very important to prevent the possibility of clobering
SOmething like routes config
should only allow once instance at a time
need a stop anywhere option
in order to target these processes need to somehow tag them
Make it so logging works without logrotate
create a status webpage
Use named pipes as default logging option which means logging is ephmeeral
run httpd in foreground
