  # The install paths have been changed to no longer violate the MacPorts mtree:

  #   1. The binaries are now under /opt/local/sbin/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/bin/)

  #   2. The configure files are now under /opt/local/etc/apache2/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/conf/)

  #   3. The modules are now under /opt/local/lib/apache2/modules/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/modules/)

  #   4. The web root is now located under /opt/local/www/apache2/html/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/htdocs/)

  #   5. The cgi-bin is now located under /opt/local/www/apache2/cgi-bin/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/cgi-bin/)

  #   6. The logs are now located under /opt/local/var/log/apache2/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/logs/)

  #   7. The manual is now located under /opt/local/www/apache2/manual/
  #      (rather than under /opt/local/apache2/manual/)

  #   8. The manual (man) pages are still at /opt/local/share/apache2/man/

  #   You can move your htdocs and cgi-bin to the new locations, or edit /opt/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf to point at the old locations.
